# dice-roller
Simple typescript dice roller; arbitrary number of dice, arbitrary side labels.

See the site at http://davidrgriswold.github.io/dice-roller

Note: The generated `rolling.js` and `rolling.js.map` files have been included so that the site will run and the devtools will show the typescript for any inspectors, but the `rolling.ts` is where the real code is.
